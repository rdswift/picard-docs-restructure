"Returns the performers where the performance type matches ``pattern`` "
"separated by ``separator`` (or a comma followed by a space \", \" if not "
"passed). If ``pattern`` is blank, then all performers will be returned. Note "
"that by default the ``pattern`` to be matched is case-sensitive and can "
"appear anywhere in the tag."

"As of version 2.7, you can explicitly define a regular expression in the "
"form /pattern/flags. The only supported flag is \"i\" (ignore case). For "
"more information about regular expressions, please see the `article on "
"Wikipedia <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>`_."

"When entering regular expressions into Picard scripts you have to escape a "
"backslash \"\\\\\", dollar sign \"$\", comma \",\" and the left and right "
"parentheses \"(\" and \")\" in order to force Picard to not interpret them "
"as part of the script command. This is done by inserting a backslash before "
"the character to be escaped. For example, the regular expression "
"``^\\s*([0-9,\\.]*)$`` would have to be entered as ``^\\\\s*\\([0-9\\,\\"
"\\.]*\\)\\$``."
