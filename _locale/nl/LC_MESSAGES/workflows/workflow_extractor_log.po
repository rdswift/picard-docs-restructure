"This option was added to Picard in version 2.8, and supports the use of log "
"files produced by :ref:`supported popular CD file rippers "
"<faq_supported_rippers>`. Because the log files of these rippers contain "
"sufficient information to generate the CD table of contents they can be used "
"in place of reading the CD. As with reading the CD itself, this method "
"provides the greatest chance of tagging your music files with the most "
"accurate match from the MusicBrainz database. It is also one of the easier "
"methods for looking up the release."

"label, catalog number, barcode, media type, and cover art). This is "
"especially important if you are going to submit any information such as "
