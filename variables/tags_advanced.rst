:index:`Advanced Tags <tags; advanced>`
=======================================

You can make additional tags available by enabling the :doc:`Use track relationships <../config/options_metadata>` and/or the :doc:`Use genres from MusicBrainz <../config/options_genres>` settings in Picard.

Some tags provide the :index:`MusicBrainz Identifier (MBID) <identifier; musicbrainz, mbid>` of the entity. The MBID is a 32-character identifier assigned to an entity (e.g.: artist, album, track or work) to uniquely identify the entity. For more information about MBIDs, please see the `MusicBrainz Identifier <https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Identifier>`_ page in the MusicBrainz documentation.

.. note::

   Tags will not be created and will not be available as variables if there was no value retrieved for the tag from the MusicBrainz database.

.. note::

   Some of these tags are only supported for certain file types or tag formats. Please see the :doc:`Picard Tag Mapping <../appendices/tag_mapping>` section for details.
