:index:`Advanced Variables <variables; advanced>`
=================================================

You can make additional tags available by enabling the :doc:`Use track relationships <../config/options_metadata>` and/or the
:doc:`Use release relationships <../config/options_metadata>` settings in Picard.

Some variables provide the :index:`MusicBrainz Identifier (MBID) <identifier; musicbrainz, mbid>` of the entity. The MBID is a 32-character identifier assigned to an entity (e.g.: artist, album, track or work) to uniquely identify the entity. For more information about MBIDs, please see the `MusicBrainz Identifier <https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Identifier>`_ page in the MusicBrainz documentation.

.. note::

   Variables will not be created if there was no value retrieved for the variable from the MusicBrainz database.
